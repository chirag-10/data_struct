DATA STRUCTURES:

What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.
While there are several basic and advanced structure types,
any data structure is designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose.
All the following programs are written in C++ language.

In the following programs we have used different types of data structures according to our purpose.


1)Pizza Parlour:
	We have used a Queue Data Structure here to accept orders and deliver i.e...enter data from one end and remove from the other.

2)Ticket Booking:
	Data structure used here is Singly Linked List.
It contains 7 head nodes that correspond to a new row of seats in the theatre.
You can cancel your book,cancel your ticket and also view information about a customer who has booked a ticket.

3)Prims Algorithm:
	Prims algorithm is an popular algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph by using a greedy approach.
Code for implementing prims algorithm is provided in the repository with the name primsAlgo.cpp

4)Shopping plaza:
	In this piece of code, we have attempted to create a backend of a shopping mall.
Admin login is required with the password as "abcd12" to login as administrator/owner of mall and add new products with the 
discount percentage that will be given to customers.
Customer can buy products and a bill wil be generated for the customer.
